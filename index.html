              As you see, there are more bad things that I'm offering than the
              good ones I haven't seen and thought about that point lately. But
              in those last few days, I started seeing in that way and I deduced
              that I'm not the right person for you. It's true that you are for
              me, but the flow does not pass between two persons if they don't
              feel the same feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm sorry for this delay. I know that each second passed my value
              is decreasing slowly and I want to thank you for every moment and
              discussion we spent you made me feel a better Version from me .
